## The Web Audio API

The Web Audio API is a new way of working with audio on the web. It
provides a way to playback pre-recorded audio, synthesise arbitrary
new sounds and control the precise moment of sound generation accurately and
reliably, irrespective of what else is happening in your application.

In this article, we’re going to learn more about the API by building a
simple drum machine. We’ll learn just enough about the API to play a
simple loop constructed from sounds we synthesise ourselves, and we’ll
see how to use recordings of real-life sounds too. From these bare
bones, you’ll be able to extend the machine yourself, or apply the
techniques you’ve learnt to other applications. Let’s get started!

### Sampling or synthesising?

Early on, we have a decision to make. Shall we synthesise the sounds
of our drum kit from scratch in the computer, or shall we use a
recording of real-life sounds — a technique also known as “sampling”?
There are pros and cons to both approaches.

Synthesising, recreating the sound of a drum using a model of its
acoustics and attempting to recreate that model in code, gives us
infinite control, but it can be very difficult to accurately
synthesise a realistic sounding drum. Sampling on the other hand means
we can start with any sound we like, but we are limited to just that
sound, perhaps with some simple transformations (playing the sound
back faster or slower, or applying some effects, for example).

In this article we’ll try and create something that sounds a bit like
the classic electronic drum machine, Roland’s TR-808. We’ll synthesise
the kick and snare, and create a hi-hat sound from a recording of the
original machine.

### The kick

We’ll kick off with the basis of all good drum loops, the kick drum.
To generate audio using the Web Audio API, your browser needs to know
about the sound producing devices available to your computer, and what
capabilities. This information is contained in the `AudioContext`.

	var context = new AudioContext;
	console.log(context.sampleRate);
	// → 44100
	console.log(context.destination.channelCount);
	// → 2

We can describe audio digitally as a series of numbers. Each number
describes the amplitude of the sound at a particular point in time. We
call each one of these numbers a “sample”[^2]. Calling
`context.sampleRate` tells us how many samples per second our device
can produce. A typical sample rate is 44,100 samples/second, as this
is sufficient to reproduce sounds at frequencies as high as we humans
can perceive. `context.destination.channelCount` gives the number of
simultaneous channels of audio our device can produce — on my computer
that’s two: one for the left speaker, and one for the right.

It would be possible, but not very user-friendly, to create the sound
we want to make by giving the computer 44,100 numbers per second, if
we knew which numbers to give it to create the sound of a kick
drum. But the Web Audio API makes the process easier by providing us
with a higher level, declarative set of commands to describe to the
computer how to make the sound we want.

	var oscillator = context.createOscillator();
	oscillator.frequency = 261.6;

	oscillator.connect(context.destination);

	oscillator.start(0);

If you type the code above into your developer console, you should
hear a low-pitched, single frequency tone at 261.6Hz (if you’re a
musician, that’s a middle C).

Make it stop? OK.

	oscillator.stop(0);

There’s a few things to note in the code above. Firstly
`createOscillator` is a method on `context` — it needs to know about
the audio environment it’s operating in to generate the sound. All of
the applications you build with Web Audio will work within an
`AudioContext`.

Secondly, we `connect` the oscillator to the `destination` of the
`context`. This is an important concept within the Web Audio API. We
call `oscillator` and `destination` instances of “nodes” and by
connecting them together we create a graph[^1].

<figure class="figure">
	<img src="{{ page.id }}/context-oscillator.png" alt="" class="figure__media">
	<figcaption class="figure__caption">Node graph of oscillator connected to destination</figcaption>
</figure>

Thirdly, calls to `start` and `stop` take the time as an argument. `0`
means to perform the operation immediately, but we can supply any
argument and it will be interpreted as the number of seconds from
now. What time is now?

	console.log(context.currentTime);
	// → 1182.5980952380953

If you’ve worked with other timing mechanisms in JavaScript before,
such as `setTimeout`, this concept of time may be slightly
unfamiliar. Here, when we say `start(0.5)` the browser will attempt, as
much as it can, to play the sound in half a second, and unlike
`setTimeout`, will not interrupt this as much as practical. This is
essential for our drum machine, as we want to schedule sounds
precisely and with an exact rhythm.

Back to our kick drum. A lot of people have researched the acoustics
of drums and how they make sound. I’ve included some further reading
at the end of this article if you’re interested in this fascinating
subject. For two-skinned drums, such as the kick drum, they’ve noticed
that the sound starts at a higher frequency — the ‘attack’ phase when
the striker hits the skin — and then rapidly falls away to a lower
frequency. While this is happening, the volume of the sound also
decreases. Once we’ve struck the drum there’s nothing to keep
producing sound so it simply decays. Let’s tackle the latter part, the
“envelope” of the sound, first.

	var oscillator = context.createOscillator();
	oscillator.frequency = 150;

	var gain = context.createGain();

	oscillator.connect(gain);
	gain.connect(context.destination);

	gain.gain.setValueAtTime(1, 0);
	gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, 0.5);
	osc.start(0);
	osc.stop(0.5);

In the code above, we’ve created this audio graph:

<figure class="figure">
	<img src="{{ page.id }}/oscillator-envelope.png" alt="" class="figure__media">
	<figcaption class="figure__caption">Node graph for an oscillator with an envelope</figcaption>
</figure>

A `gain` node is like a volume control. We can use that to control the
amplitude of our oscillator over time. It has a parameter `gain` which
we can automate. We do that by calling the functions `setValueAtTime`,
which sets the gain to be `1` at time `0` and
`exponentialRampToValueAtTime` which decreases the gain to close to
zero over the next `0.5` seconds. Any parameter on any node in the Web
Audio API can be automated in this way if it implements the
`AudioParam` interface:

	console.log(gain.gain);
	// → AudioParam { defaultValue: 1, value: 1, setValueAtTime: function, linearRampToValueAtTime: function, exponentialRampToValueAtTime: function… }

Armed with this knowledge, we now know how to complete our kick drum
synthesis: by dropping the frequency of the oscillator rapidly after
the initial attack.

	oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(150, 0);
	oscillator.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, 0.5);

If you’ve been following along with the code in this article, you may
have noticed that once you call `stop` on an oscillator, it’s
impossible to call `start` again. This is intentional — it allows the
browser to garbage-collect the nodes more efficiently in large audio
graphs — but it does make working with these drum sounds more
complicated as we’d like a way to trigger them multiple times. We can
solve this by wrapping the code we’ve written in a simple object:

	function Kick(context) {
		this.context = context;
	};

	Kick.prototype.setup = function() {
		this.osc = this.context.createOscillator();
		this.gain = this.context.createGain();
		this.osc.connect(this.gain);
		this.gain.connect(this.context.destination)
	};

	Kick.prototype.trigger = function(time) {
		this.setup();

		this.osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(150, time);
		this.gain.gain.setValueAtTime(1, time);

		this.osc.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, time + 0.5);
		this.gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, time + 0.5);

		this.osc.start(time);

		this.osc.stop(time + 0.5);
	};

We store a reference to the audio context when we create the kick, and
then each time we trigger the kick sound we can pass in a time, which
creates the audio graph and schedules the parameter changes.

	kick = new Kick(context);
	kick.trigger(0);
	kick.trigger(0.5);
	kick.trigger(1);

### The Snare Drum

A snare drum has a rigid shell holding two, taught drum
membranes. When the top membrane is struck, a series of wire springs
held underneath the lower membrane rattle in sympathy. There’s a
complexity to the snare sound that makes it more challenging to
synthesise. But we can tackle it in stages to make the process easier.

First, the rattle of the wire snare underneath the drum can be
synthesised using a burst of noise. We can create noise using a random
number generator.

	function Snare(context) {
		this.context = context;
	};

	Snare.prototype.noiseBuffer = function() {
		var bufferSize = this.context.sampleRate;
		var buffer = this.context.createBuffer(1, bufferSize, this.context.sampleRate);
		var output = buffer.getChannelData(0);

		for (var i = 0; i < bufferSize; i++) {
			output[i] = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
		}

		return buffer;
	};

In this code we create a “buffer” of individual samples, which we can
later trigger at a precise time. The call to `createBuffer` specifies
that the buffer has a single channel, 44100 individual samples, at a
sample rate of 44100 Hz. That is, 1 second of audio in total. This
should be sufficient for our purposes since the sound of an individual
snare hit is very short.

We fill the buffer with random numbers between `-1` and `1`. This even
distribution of random numbers creates “white” noise, which is noise
with equal energy at every frequency. Removing some of the highest
frequency sound from this noise creates a more realistic sounding
snare. We can do that using a filter:

	Snare.prototype.setup = function() {
		this.noise = this.context.createBufferSource();
		this.noise.buffer = this.noiseBuffer();
		var noiseFilter = this.context.createBiquadFilter();
		noiseFilter.type = 'highpass';
		noiseFilter.frequency.value = 1000;
		this.noise.connect(noiseFilter);
		// …
	};

We set the cutoff `frequency` of the filter at 1000 Hz. This means
noise above 1000 Hz will be removed. We also need to shape the
amplitude of the noise burst using an envelope, as we did before with
the snare drum.

	// …
	this.noiseEnvelope = this.context.createGain();
	noiseFilter.connect(this.noiseEnvelope);

	this.noiseEnvelope.connect(this.context.destination);
	// …

A short burst of filtered noise on its own doesn’t create a very good
sounding snare. Adding a sharp “snap” to the front of the sound helps
to make the snare sound more percussive. We can achieve this using an
oscillator set to generate a triangle waveform, and again shape that
using a `GainNode` as an envelope.

	// …
	this.osc = this.context.createOscillator();
	this.osc.type = 'triangle';

	this.oscEnvelope = this.context.createGain();
	this.osc.connect(this.oscEnvelope);
	this.oscEnvelope.connect(this.context.destination);

We have created this graph of nodes for our snare sound:

<figure class="figure">
	<img src="{{ page.id }}/snare.png" alt="" class="figure__media">
	<figcaption class="figure__caption">Node graph for an synthesised snare</figcaption>
</figure>

Now we just need to provide some parameters for each of the
nodes. After some fiddling, I found these parameters created quite a
satisfying, snappy snare:

	Snare.prototype.trigger = function(time) {
		this.setup();

		this.noiseEnvelope.gain.setValueAtTime(1, time);
		this.noiseEnvelope.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, time + 0.2);
		this.noise.start(time)

		this.osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(100, time);
		this.oscEnvelope.gain.setValueAtTime(0.7, time);
		this.oscEnvelope.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, time + 0.1);
		this.osc.start(time)

		this.osc.stop(time + 0.2);
		this.noise.stop(time + 0.2);
	};

### The hi-hat

Synthesising a realistic-sounding hi-hat is hard. When you strike a
disk of metal the sound that is produced is a complex mixture of
unevenly-spaced harmonics which decay at different rates. It’s not an
impossible task, and if you’re interested there’s some further reading
below, but for this post we’re going to cheat a little by sampling an
existing sound. By doing this you’ll also learn how sampling, taking
short recordings of sound and using them as the basis of new sounds,
can be achieved with the Web Audio API.

Our basic instrument is simple:

	function HiHat(context, buffer) {
		this.context = context;
		this.buffer = buffer;
	};

	HiHat.prototype.setup = function() {
		this.source = this.context.createBufferSource();
		this.source.buffer = this.buffer;
		this.source.connect(this.context.destination);
	};

	HiHat.prototype.trigger = function(time) {
		this.setup();
		this.source.start(time);
	};

When we instantiate the `HiHat` object, we give it a buffer of
samples. The `setup` function assigns the buffer of samples to a
`BufferSource` node, and calling `trigger` plays the samples back at
the given time.

Where do we get our source buffer of samples from? Remember from our
snare drum example earlier, we generated a buffer using a random
number generator. But we can also create one by loading a file:

	var sampleLoader = function(url, context, callback) {
		var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
		request.open('get', url, true);
		request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
		request.onload = function() {
			context.decodeAudioData(request.response, function(buffer) {
				callback(buffer);
			});
		};
		request.send();
	};

This function takes a URL of a sound file and makes an asynchronous
GET request for it using `XMLHttpRequest`. Then the data is loaded,
the call to `context.decodeAudioData` turns the audio file into a
buffer of samples, and triggers a callback. The file formats that
`decodeAudioData` understand are the same as those supported by the
`<audio>` tag in your browser. In Opera, OGG, WAV and MP3 are
supported, for example.

Remember that the network and decoding requests are asynchronous, so
we have to wait until they are completed before we can create the
`HiHat` that uses the loaded buffer:

	sampleLoader('/hihat.wav', context, function(buffer) {
		var hihat = new HiHat(context, buffer);
		hihat.trigger(0);
	});

## Timing

In this final section, we’re going to combine the three drum sounds
we’ve made into a simple loop. As we’ve seen, the Web Audio API
provides a precise timing mechanism which allows you to schedule audio
events to happen relative to the `AudioContext`'s `currentTime`.

Internally, the browser is executing these events on a thread that is
separate to the thread in which normal JavaScript events are run. This
means that there is overhead in passing data between the two
threads. For this reason, it is not possible to create a callback that
fires when an audio event happens (such as when one of our drum sounds
starts or stops playing), and register changes in reaction to this
(such as scheduling a new drum sound to play).

To build a loop, especially one where we have control over the tempo,
the parameters, and which notes play, we have to listen for changes in
the main thread, and schedule those changes to happen in the future on
the audio thread. We don’t want to schedule them too far in the future
though, as this makes our application unresponsive. Scheduling them
too soon is also a problem — we might cause glitches in the sound if
something happens in the rest of our application and we miss the
scheduling of the changes.

In [this HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)
article, Chris Wilson describes the issues with timing in more detail
and gives some code examples of good and bad practice. Other
developers have taken these ideas and wrapped them up in libraries
that make working with time in Web Audio applications much easier:

- [WAAClock](https://github.com/sebpiq/WAAClock) packages the ideas
	from Chris Wilson’s article into a library, with a simple interface
	and some clear examples.
- [Dilla](https://github.com/adamrenklint/dilla) is a timing library
	specialised for building drum machines. It models the concept of
	beats, bars, and loops and has a notation language for describing
	the timing of sounds in the loop.
- [Tone.js](https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js) is a comprehensive
	set of libraries for making all kinds of sounds. As well as a timing
	library, it also has built-in synthesisers and effects processors
	which provide abstractions over more complicated Web Audio node
	graphs.

All of these libraries make it easy to build a simple loop, and it’s a
fun exercise to try each one and see which one is the best fit for you
and the application you are building. As an example, I’ll use
`Tone.js` to build a simple loop.

	var play = function(buffer) {
		var kick = new Kick(context);
		var snare = new Snare(context);
		var hihat = new HiHat(context, buffer);

		Tone.Transport.bpm.value = 120;

		Tone.Transport.setInterval(function(time){ kick.trigger(time) }, "4n");
		Tone.Transport.setInterval(function(time){ snare.trigger(time) }, "2n");
		Tone.Transport.setInterval(function(time){ hihat.trigger(time) }, "8t");

		Tone.Transport.start();
	};

	sampleLoader('/hihat.wav', context, play);

In this code, `Tone.Transport` is the interface to the `Tone.js`
[timing library](https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js/wiki/Transport). We
set a tempo for our loop using the `bpm` property — here 120 beats per
minute. The `Transport.setInterval` method is used to schedule
repeating events. We can think of it as working like a regular
`setInterval` but for scheduling of events relative to the audio
clock. The time value passed to `Transport.setInterval` can be
expressed, as here, in a musical way rather than in seconds. `4n`
means 4 beats to the bar, `2n is two beats` and `8t` creates
eighth-note triplets on the hihat. The value is converted into seconds
and passed in as the `time` parameter to our `trigger` methods, so we
don't need to modify our code to work with this library.

Finally, we call the `play` method when the hihat sample has loaded,
which starts our loop.
